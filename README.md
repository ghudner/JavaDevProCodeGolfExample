# Welcome to DevPro Code Golf - Java Edition! 


- This repo contains **5 challenge files** `ChallengeX.java`.
- Inside each file, you’ll find a **single function** stub that you must implement.
- **You may only modify the function body** (no touching the test harness, no sneaky imports—yes, we’ll know 😎).

Open this repo in **IntelliJ** or **VS Code**. Running the **DevProCodeGolfMain.java** main function will run **10 test cases per challenge** and tell you whether each test passed or failed.

If you pass all challenges in and all test cases, you’ll see this message:  🏆🏆🏆 !!All challenges passed!! 🏆🏆🏆

## 🎯 Scoring Rules

- Your score is the **character count of your function** (Lower is better)
- **BUT**... for each test failure you get, you’ll be slapped with a **+100 character penalty** so make sure all test cases pass first!

## 🚨 Pro Tips

- Yes, you can use one-letter variables.
- Yes, you can abuse Java’s weirdest quirks.
- Yes, it has to compile (no infinite golfing without finishing the hole).
